# Compartir
Compartir (Espanol for sharing) is a file sharing program that works over LAN or hotspot

## Pros
* It needs only to be installed on the PC that is sharing the files
* Allows people to share any folder in their PC
* Allows the receivers to download a folder, or subfolder, at once
* Allows more than one person to get files from the sharing computer simultaneously (theroetically)

## Cons
* It's not very fast, **yet**.
