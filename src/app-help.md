## How To Share Files

1. First create a hotspot on your machine.

3. Click the button ```START SERVER``` button to start the server.
4. Share the ```Server URL``` and hotspot details with the people you want share the files with.

### Importart!!!
 * Compartir, currently does not have security feature to avoid anyone else from accessing the file once you start the server. Only share the hotspot details with the people you want to share your files with.
 * Also note that all subfolders of the folder you share wil be accessible to the people you share.
 * More than one person can download files from your machine, but at the cost of transfer speed for each of them. However for small files, or just browsing, it doesn't make any difference.
 * If people are failing to access you files, probably the firewall is active on your machine. Try disabling it and then retry again.
